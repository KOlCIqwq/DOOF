## Motivation
Through a friend’s recommendation I stumbled upon a barcode scanning application. While useful, I noticed that the application only offered a simple “healthy or not” evaluation of food products. 

So why not build an application that combines barcode scanning with food inventory management and personal health tracking?

From this concept, DOOF was born. A tool that allows user to scan product barcode, track and organize them in an inventory and integrate calories and nutrition trackeing into daily routine

## Features
- Fetch the product details by scanning the 1D barcodes or QR codes
- Add, organize, and track products in a personal food inventory
- Log consumed products to automatically record their nutritional value and calorie intake
- Discover recipes, log them, and track their nutritional contribution
- Automatically calculate daily consumption targets based on user profile (age, height, weight,...)
